 I'm leading a workshop for third through fifth graders and I introduced them to Claude artifacts and using your voice to create novel applications and tools without having a code to demonstrate the power of this tool and we did this in conjunction with the writing workshop and so my students built writing tools, and they've been developing those through the Claude chat panel and been using an artifact, which, of course is just one monolithic file and we're now at the point of the workshop where we will be publishing these to the web and allow allowing for judges to use them and just the general public whoever might want to use them and so I'm asking you to help me translate the JSX file in this primary folder into a publishable Web App that I'll just be using net modified to publish so I'll just use GitHub to store the files up there and then net. I will publish to the website but I'd like for you to number one you know try to be as faithful as possible to what the student has turned in here but I'd like for you to go and optimize the app for publishing into the web and so if that means a breaking it up into multiple files and building it into a sound architecture that's perfectly fine. I realize that I will need to give you an API key for Claude, which we will be using on the back end here so for all of those calls in the code that are using the artifact API just let me know what I need to do to give you an API key to develop this out. I'd also be interested in your feedback on any other improvements or I guess if there are bugs in the code that you can find and we can remediate those before you know publishing the web obviously I'm interested in that. Also, maybe if we could build a website that you know goes around it so that when users land on the front page they're given you know a brief explanation of what the tool does you know I don't wanna make this too fancy because I want it to be authentic to wit. The student has done and I'm not asking you to create an advertising site for them but perhaps a landing page that says you know use the tool here that has a big button, but just like kind of puts the premise of what the tool does in a compelling term there maybe we can do that in a second phase I'm interested to hear your thoughts as well thanks for your help on this
